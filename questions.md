## Kubernetes Interview Questions and Answers

### Category 1: Kubernetes Basics 

**Q1. What is Kubernetes, and why is it important?**  
**A1.** Kubernetes is an open-source container orchestration platform that automates deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. It’s crucial for handling large-scale, dynamic environments, ensuring high availability and efficient resource usage.

**Q2. What are the main components of the Kubernetes control plane?**  
**A2.** The main control plane components are:  
1. **API Server** – The front-end of the cluster.  
2. **etcd** – A key-value store for cluster data.  
3. **Controller Manager** – Runs controllers to handle cluster-level functions.  
4. **Scheduler** – Distributes workloads (Pods) across nodes.

**Q3. What is a node in Kubernetes?**  
**A3.** A node (worker node) is a machine (virtual or physical) that runs containerized applications. Each node runs the container runtime (e.g., Docker or containerd), the kubelet agent, and a network proxy (kube-proxy).

**Q4. What is the role of `kubelet`?**  
**A4.** `kubelet` is an agent that runs on each node. It receives Pod definitions from the API Server, ensures containers described in those Pods are running, and reports node health status.

**Q5. How does Kubernetes ensure high availability of the control plane?**  
**A5.** By deploying multiple replicas of the API Server and ensuring redundant instances of etcd. Load balancers distribute requests, and if one control plane instance fails, others take over.

**Q6. What is the difference between declarative and imperative management in Kubernetes?**  
**A6.** *Declarative* uses YAML/JSON manifests to define the desired state, while *imperative* uses commands (e.g., `kubectl run`) to directly manage objects. Declarative is preferred for GitOps and maintainable configurations.

**Q7. Can you explain `kubectl` and its common commands?**  
**A7.** `kubectl` is the CLI tool for interacting with the cluster. Common commands include:  
- `kubectl get` – list resources  
- `kubectl describe` – show detailed info  
- `kubectl apply` – apply a manifest  
- `kubectl delete` – remove resources

**Q8. What is a Kubernetes cluster context?**  
**A8.** A context in Kubernetes is a combination of a cluster, namespace, and user configuration. It allows you to switch between different clusters/environments easily using `kubectl config use-context`.

**Q9. How do you upgrade a Kubernetes cluster?**  
**A9.** Typically, upgrade the control plane components (API Server, etcd) first, then the nodes. Use tools like `kubeadm` or managed services to carefully proceed node by node to avoid downtime.

**Q10. What is the concept of desired state in Kubernetes?**  
**A10.** The desired state is defined in the cluster’s manifests (YAML/JSON). Kubernetes controllers continually check if the current state matches the desired state and take corrective actions if there’s a drift.

**Q11. How do you configure logging in Kubernetes?**  
**A11.** Kubernetes doesn’t provide a native logging solution but integrates with logging agents (e.g., Fluentd) that collect container logs from stdout/stderr. These logs can be forwarded to external systems like Elasticsearch or Splunk.

**Q12. Can you define a manifest for a simple Pod?**  
**A12.** A minimal Pod YAML might look like:
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: mypod
spec:
  containers:
  - name: mycontainer
    image: nginx:latest

**Q13. What is `etcd` and its role in Kubernetes?**  
**A13.** `etcd` is a distributed key-value store that stores cluster configuration data. Kubernetes uses `etcd` to persist cluster state and configuration details reliably.

**Q14. How do Labels and Annotations differ in Kubernetes?**  
**A14.**  
- **Labels** are key/value pairs used for grouping and selecting objects (for example, by Services or `kubectl` queries).  
- **Annotations** provide non-identifying metadata for storing additional information. They are not used for selection.

---

**Q15. What is a Namespace, and why is it used?**  
**A15.** A Namespace is a way to divide cluster resources between multiple users (via resource quota). It helps organize objects and is often used for environment isolation, multi-tenancy, and policy enforcement.

---

**Q16. How do you set resource quotas in Kubernetes?**  
**A16.** You create a `ResourceQuota` object in a specific Namespace. It defines limits on resource consumption, like CPU, memory, and object counts, within that Namespace.

---

**Q17. What is the ClusterIP?**  
**A17.** A ClusterIP is the default Service type in Kubernetes. It makes the Service reachable only from within the cluster via an internal IP. It’s useful for internal communication between Pods.

---

**Q18. Why use ConfigMaps and Secrets instead of baking config into Docker images?**  
**A18.**  
- Externalizing configuration makes images reusable.  
- Secrets protect sensitive data (passwords, tokens) differently from ConfigMaps.  
- Both can be updated without rebuilding container images, adhering to best practices for security and flexibility.

**Q19. How is Kubernetes extended by CRDs (Custom Resource Definitions)?**  
**A19.** CRDs let you create your own custom API resources that appear and behave like built-in Kubernetes resources. This extensibility enables you to define custom controllers and Operators that manage application-specific logic.

---

**Q20. What happens when you run `kubectl apply -f <file>`?**  
**A20.**  
1. Kubernetes reads the manifest in `<file>`.  
2. The manifest is sent to the API Server.  
3. The API Server stores or updates the desired state in `etcd`.  
4. Kubernetes controllers reconcile the actual state to match the desired state defined in the manifest.
